# Principles of Dimensionality

To make data driven decision we need
- one or more measurements.
- Dimensional context for each measurement.

Dimensional Context most often answer question by ? and for?

**If we organize data by measurements, filtered and grouped by context it will help us to make data driven decisions.**

- OLAP is key part of BI, OLAP means dimensional analysis.
- Dimensional analysis is done using dimensional data.
- Dimensional data means = facts, dimensions, fact tables and dimension tables.
# Facts
- Measurements = Facts
- **Numeric** and quantifiable
- Mostly a metric
- Logical fact not equal to Data warehouse fact
- Facts are stored in fact table
- Fact is not equal to Fact table
# Dimension
- context for a fact = dimension

# Star vs Snowflake
- We represent fact and dimensions in either Start schema or snowflake schema
## star Schema
- In star schema we put all the 3 information about product in a single dimension table called Product hierarchy dimension table.
- 3 dimension(from same hierarchy) in 1 dimension table

## Snowflake Schema
- 3 dimension = 3 dimension table

**Both start and snowflake has same data but represented in different forms.**

# Forms of Additivity
 A datawarehouse fact can be
 1. Additive  Fact == can be added under all circumstances eg. Salary. here we can add veritically salary of all employees

    also horizontally salary of same persion across time

  2. Non- Additive - example GPA we cant add GPA of all the students in class, ratios, calculated Average.
     - For a Non additive fact store the underlying component (eg. marks) in fact tables.
     - we can also store the non- additive fact as an additional row for easy access.
      
  3. Semi- Additive
     - we can add them sometimes but cannot add them other times.


# Database Keys.
## Primary Key
  - unique key
 
## foreign Key
  - some other table's primary
  - used to denote logical relationship

## Natural Key
  - Might be cryptic (roll_no, employee_id) or might be undestandable (department name, job role)
  - They are not generated in data warehouse, they travel from the source system with the data
## Surogate key
 - No business meaning, but simply generated in random
 - Usually a cryptic, but not same as natural key
 - Generated by the database itself or using a supplemental key management system.
 - Preferred over a natural key in data warehouse
 - should be used for the primary keys of the dimension tables
 - In below example Faculty_key is the surrogate key that is generated. usually used with _key in column name.

# PTR
- Data in user access layer should be structured dimensionaly (Fact table and dimension table)
- Fact and dimension tables provide the foundation for the user access layer, and supply the dimensionality
